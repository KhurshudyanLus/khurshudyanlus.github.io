                    <h4>About Me | Technical Knowledge | Soft Skills</h4>
                    <h3>Pawn in Chess</h3>
                    <p class="blackbox">

                        With a diverse background in IT and quality management, I've 
                        developed a robust skill set. At Telus International, I honed 
                        time management, problem-solving, and attention to detail as a 
                        Quality Analyst and Team Lead. My tenure at Neetry and Wesage 
                        as an IT Project Manager further enriched my decision-making, 
                        organizational, communication, leadership, negotiation, and empathy skills.
                        Additionally, these positions provided me with a deeper understanding of 
                        the operational dynamics of e-commerce platforms.<br>

                        <br>  I bring technical expertise in HTML, CSS, and a basic understanding
                         of JavaScript, enabling me to contribute effectively to web development projects and communicate 
                        seamlessly with development teams. Proficient in project management 
                        tools such as Jira and Trello, I streamline workflows to enhance 
                        productivity. My knowledge spans Agile (Scrum,Kanban), and Waterfall 
                        methodologies, adapting flexibly to diverse project requirements.<br>

                        <br> Additionally, I have hands-on experience with Git and GitHub for 
                        version control and utilize Postman for API testing. These technical 
                        skills complement my ability to manage projects comprehensively, 
                        ensuring efficient delivery and quality outcomes. In addition, I have a basic knowledge
                        of MySQL which enhances my ability to interact with databases and support data-driven 
                        project requirements effectively.
                        
                        <br> <br>Chess is my main hobby, fostering a strategic mindset crucial 
                        for anticipating challenges and planning effectively in my career. 
                        Like a pawn in chess, given the right opportunities and environment, 
                        I aim to evolve and contribute effectively to achieving organizational goals.
