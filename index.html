                    <h4>About Me | Technical Knowledge | Soft Skills</h4>
                    <h3>Knight in Chess</h3>
                    <p class="blackbox">

                        With a background spanning IT, quality management, and e-commerce, I excel at coordinating 
                        teams, optimizing workflows, and ensuring high-quality project outcomes. I have honed 
                        <span class="text-magenta">excellent time management, organizational skills, communication</span>, and 
                        <span class="text-magenta">the ability to assess, manage, and mitigate risks</span> across diverse projects. Leading IT initiatives 
                        strengthened my decision-making, <span class="text-magenta">stakeholder management</span>, and <span class="text-magenta">strategic thinking</span>, 
                        while deepening my understanding of operational and technical dynamics in digital platforms.<br>

                        <br>  Technically, I bring hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, a bit of JavaScript, Git/GitHub 
                        version control, MySQL, and API testing with Postman. I am proficient with project 
                        management tools such as Jira and Trello, and adept at Agile (Scrum, Kanban) and Waterfall 
                        methodologies, allowing me to adapt flexibly to diverse project requirements and deliver 
                        results efficiently.<br>
                        
                        <br> <br>Chess is my main hobby, fostering a strategic mindset crucial 
                        for anticipating challenges and planning effectively in my career. 
                        2.5 years ago, I would have described myself as a <span class="text-aqua">pawn</span> in chess: learning 
                        the basics and finding my place on the board. Over time, with the right 
                        opportunities and environment, I’ve <span class="text-magenta">evolved into a knight</span>, leveraging 
                        strategic thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability to make meaningful moves. 
                        My goal is to continue growing, aiming one day to play the role of a queen, 
                        maximizing impact and driving success.
