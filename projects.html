                        <h4>Built in 3 weeks</h4>
                        <h3>Kinetics</h3>
                        <p class="blackbox">
                            I am particularly proud of the Kinetics project, which I took
                             on at the beginning of September with a tight deadline of 
                             October 1st. With only one month to identify dependencies, 
                             unblock blockers, plan the roadmap, execute, test, and 
                             prepare the site for client UAT, I approached the challenge 
                             with careful planning and clear communication. I coordinated 
                             access, managed extensions, and removed obstacles that could 
                             delay progress. Despite having only theoretical knowledge of 
                             Shopify, I learned quickly on the job to assist the client 
                             with technical questions and requests. Simultaneously, I 
                             managed another project scheduled to go live at the same time. 
                             Ultimately, both projects were delivered on schedule and with high 
                             quality, including a fully functioning Shopify store for 
                             Kinetics in just three weeks. After this project, the client
                             signed other contracts bringing profit to my company.

                        <h4>WordPress to Magento Migration</h4>
                        <h3>Satmodo</h3>
                        <p class="blackbox">
                            I was the PM of a complex migration from WordPress to Magento, 
                            participating in client interviews, requirement gathering, and clarifications.
                             After creating a detailed project roadmap, we executed a migration that spanned
                              several months due to product specifics and infrastructure differences. 
                              I served as the primary point of contact for both technical and managerial questions, 
                              guiding both teams toward alignment and ensuring practical, efficient solutions. 
                              Working alongside an additional development agency, I established clear 
                              communication and collaboration principles to maintain progress and 
                              prevent unnecessary complications. The successful completion of this 
                              project led the client to commission a new website theme and sign 
                              another major contract, contributing to my company’s revenue growth.

                        <p class="blackbox">
                           I took over this project at a critical stage, where the client was expecting
                            to go live soon, but the team was exhausted, the site was not ready, and the 
                            project board was disorganized. I was responsible for managing client expectations, 
                            finalizing key implementations, ensuring thorough QA, and supporting team morale. 
                            I focused on being structured, transparent, and communicative with both the client 
                            and the team. I streamlined the project board, prioritized tasks based on 
                            impact—distinguishing between critical/high-priority items for go-live and 
                            lower-priority tasks for Phase 2—and coordinated with third parties to confirm 
                            requirements for launch readiness. I shared the plan with the client, created a 
                            clear roadmap, and arranged weekly update calls. Additionally, I organized 
                            Agile ceremonies to keep the team on track, ensuring timely delivery with high quality.

                        <h4>The First Project</h4>
                        <h3>Youtube</h3>
                        <p class="blackbox">
                            In my first project, I developed a YouTube clone using HTML and CSS. 
                            Initially, I added pseudo-classes everywhere and had a lot of irrelevant code. 
                            Recently, I reviewed and cleaned up the code, removing unnecessary parts and 
                            minimizing it. I learned key web development concepts such as `div`, `grid`, `flex`,
                             tooltips, and buttons. Flexbox created a responsive header and sidebar, while CSS Grid
                              ensured a uniform video layout. I styled thumbnails, titles, usernames, and stats, 
                              adding tooltips, hover effects, and custom buttons for interactivity. 
                              The design is responsive, adapting to various screen sizes. 
                              Due to this project,  I gained new knowledge on the smallest units of web development.

                        <h3>Instagram</h3>
                        <p class="blackbox">
                            In my second project, I cloned my Instagram page after completing my YouTube clone project.
                             I did everything on my own, applying the skills I learned previously. This project involved using
                              HTML and CSS to create the layout and design, including the header, sidebar, profile section, 
                              and photo grid. I implemented Flexbox for the responsive header and sidebar, and CSS Grid for 
                              arranging the posts and story highlights. I also added a small JavaScript function to zoom in on images
                               when clicked. This project further solidified my understanding of web development fundamentals 
                               and allowed me to explore basic JavaScript interactivity.

                        <p class="blackbox">
                            I developed two projects to enhance my web development skills. The first
                            is an up-to-date calendar using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which dynamically
                            displays the current date with a clean design. The second project is a random
                            picture uploader that uses an API to fetch and display random images when the
                            "Load More" button is clicked. This project also employs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                            Both projects helped me deepen my understanding of JavaScript functionality and API
                            integration while focusing on creating visually appealing and interactive web applications.
