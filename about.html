                        After taking a 1.5-year break from the IT world, I returned as an 
                        IT Project Manager at Magebit, where I managed projects of varying
                         complexity, meeting tight deadlines, creating project roadmaps, and 
                         planning, executing, and monitoring tasks based on team capacity and 
                         project timelines. I collaborated with cross-functional teams while 
                         managing client expectations and stakeholders. One achievement I am 
                         particularly proud of is delivering a fully functioning website 
                         from scratch in just three weeks, thanks to detailed planning and 
                         proactive risk mitigation. I have hands-on experience with JIRA and 
                         recently obtained the PSPO I certification. For more details on my 
                         experience and projects, please visit the <a href="projects.html"><span>Projects</span></a> page.

                        I developed a robust and diverse career, marked by a series of 
                        roles that each contributed to my extensive skill set. I was a 
                        Team Lead and Quality Analyst at TELUS International, where 
                        I excelled in time management, problem-solving, attention to detail, 
                        and conflict resolution. In this role, I maintained high-quality 
                        production standards, managed stakeholder communication, 
                        conducted team meetings, provided coaching, and offered guidance to my team.

                    <p class="blackbox">
                        Before relocating to Latvia, I worked as an IT Project Manager at Neetry 
                        LLC in Armenia from April 1st to August 1st, 2023. During my tenure, I 
                        enhanced my expertise in Agile methodologies, specifically Kanban, and 
                        collaborated closely with developers and UX/UI teams using the Jira 
                        management tool. My responsibilities included project planning and execution, 
                        stakeholder communication and management, monitoring and conducting project 
                        status meetings, task creation and assignment, and fostering a collaborative 
                        work environment.

                    <p class="blackbox">
                        My career in IT began at WeSage, where I served as an IT Project Manager 
                        from April 4th, 2022, to January 16th, 2023. At WeSage, I was responsible 
                        for project planning and execution, stakeholder communication and management, 
                        monitoring project progress, conducting status meetings, task creation and 
                        assignment, and cultivating a collaborative work environment.Unfortunately, in 
                        Januray this company got closed, so I had to find another job.
